# Port Scanner

## Description

This Port Scanner is a powerful and efficient network tool designed to scan and identify open ports on a target machine or IP address. Utilizing a multi-threaded approach, it allows for rapid scanning of a wide range of ports, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities or services running on a target device. With options to customize the port range and the number of threads used for scanning, it's an adaptable tool for network administrators, security professionals, and anyone interested in network security.

## Features

- Fast and efficient scanning using multi-threading.
- Customizable port range for targeted scanning.
- Option to set the number of threads for concurrent scans.
- Clear and concise output of open ports.
- Compatibility with various operating systems thanks to Python's cross-platform nature.
